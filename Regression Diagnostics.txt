### Regression Diagnostics

## Issue: Linear regression is a model

## "All models are wrong, some are useful."
			- George Box


## Assumptions of the linear model:
	## Linearity

mod = lm(mpg ~ hp, data=mtcars)
summary(mod)

plot(mod) ## Gives me 4 diagnostic plots of that model

## Plot 1: Residuals vs Leverage
## NORMALITY   ##  95% of the values should be between -2 and 2
## INFLUNCE    ## Few data should be beyond the red dotted curves
		## Data points far beyond the dotted curves are 
		## overly influential, and can change your 
		## beta estimates by a lot all on their.


## Plot 2: Linearity Plot (Residuals vs Fitted)
## LINEARITY ## Is the red line showing a major curve pattern
		(mtcars observation, Maserati Bora could be a problem)

## Plot 3: Normal Quantile-Quantile
## NORMALITY	## The values should be on the dotted line.
		## Expect some values at the end to 'peel' away.
		## Larger deviations from the line 
		## Imply deviations from normality.


## Plot 4: Scale-Location
## EQUAL VARIANCE  (Is there only the one sigma^2 for all residuals)
	## If the variance is increasing with the fitted responses
	## Then the red line will be increasing / sloped up.
	## Ideally, the line has no slope or trend.



### Plot the actual variables (simple regression, two variables)
plot( mpg ~ hp, data=mtcars)
abline(mod) ## mod is the model from lm()

### Graphical options
## main =  "MAIN TITLE"
## xlab = "x axis label"
## ylab = "y axis label"
## col = colour
## cex = Character EXpansion
## lab.cex = Label Character EXpansion
## las = Orientation of axes
## lty = Line Type (Solid, Dotted, Dashed)
## lwd = Line WiDth
## pch = Point CHaracter (Circles, Triangles, Letters)

plot(mpg ~ hp, data=mtcars, col="Blue", cex=2, pch=17, las=1)
abline(mod, lty=1, lwd=6, col="Red")




### Plot ALL the variables
pairs(mtcars)


### Excellent reference for all things R
http://www.statmethods.net

### Reference for GGplot2
http://www.statmethods.net/advgraphs/ggplot2.html


library(ggplot2)
qplot(hp, mpg, data=mtcars, geom=c("point", "smooth"),
   method="lm", formula=y~x)



### qplot the ggplot2 version of plot()
### qplot(x,y    ## The x and y values of interest
### 	data =    the data.frame of interest
###	geom=c()  what type of geometric shapes to include
		( "point","smooth" will give you the prediction bands)
###	method="lm"   linear model (regression) method
###	formula=y~x	self explanatory
###	color=cyl	if you wish to split by a 3rd variable, split by color
